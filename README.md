# Cross-protocol cloud-event library

**UNSTABLE EXPERIMENTAL CODE**

Go libraries for multi-format, multi-binding cloud events

Package [lightning](https://godoc.org/github.com/alanconway/lightning/pkg/lightning) provides an abstract event implementation, extensible format conversions and interfaces for bindings.

Package [amqp](https://godoc.org/github.com/alanconway/lightning/pkg/amqp) is an AMQP binding

Package [mqtt](https://godoc.org/github.com/alanconway/lightning/pkg/amqp) is an MQTT 3.1.1 binding

Package [http](https://godoc.org/github.com/alanconway/lightning/pkg/http) is an HTTP binding

Lightning is designed to be extensible, so new formats and bindings can be added.
